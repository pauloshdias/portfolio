Description: <p>Inspired by nineteenth-century British opulence, an era of elegance unsurpassed, Standards premium playing cards redefine luxury at the card table. Produced by Art of Play in collaboration with Kevin Cantrell Studio and crafted with meticulous attention to detail. </p><p>Printed by The United States Playing Card Company on our proprietary thin-stock developed for cardists.</p><p>For this reason, and in contrast, the proposed design system looks forward to minimalism and discreet design so to have the least impact possible in the cards design appreciation.</p><p>
    Thus allowing the cards to excel and to stand out. This is achieved with a low contrast background only introducing contrasting elements where necessary.</p>

        <p>The goal of this design was meant to be as easy and as simples to use as possible. For that reason, and because de product allowed it the product page was embedded in the main homepage.</p><p>To a cardistry affectionate, the most important is to see the package, the card’s back, the court cards and an example of a numbered card. On top of these, it’s important to offer a description of the deck’s concept and a word about the designer.</p>

        <p>This design solution allows for a huge reduction of pages and clicks merging the address and payment inputs as well as the card confirmation pages.</p><p>This way the user can deal with all the requirements all on one page. Note for the payment methods wich each option will open a different set of input requirements underneath the chosen option.</p><p>This not only reduces the number of processes the user has to go through as well as reduces the number of pages to be developed.</p>
