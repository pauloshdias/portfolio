        <h3>Image Size</h3>
         <p>One of the requirements was for it to be accessible and scalable in terms of pixel density. In that regard, I created 3 different image resolutions depending on screen size, under the tags < picture > and < source >.
            Being this a photography portfolio, I deliberately created images a little bit heavier than usual as they would be the 'main attraction' of the site.</p>

        <p>The photo at the right does not have diferent resolution media because it will only show up on the desktop view. Only when the viewport reaches 1024px of size will this image becone visible.</p>

        <h3>Performance</h3>
        <p>According to Google Chrome's audit function, the overall score of the site is 94 and 96 respectively for Desktop and mobile versions. This is partially due to the use of the 3 larger images which are heavier than normal, albeit purposely so.

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>As to what accessibility it's concerned, I used a vast array of tags such as < aria-label >, < title >, < lang >,< alt > atributes, etc.
                These tags and attributes, alongside other code details, allow screen readers to be able to read the website and allow a blind user to interact with it. At the same time, it allows for better SEO.</p>
