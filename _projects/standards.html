description: "Inspired by nineteenth-century British opulence, an era of elegance unsurpassed, Standards premium playing
cards redefine luxury at the card table. Produced by Art of Play in collaboration with Kevin Cantrell Studio and crafted
with meticulous attention to detail. Printed by The United States Playing Card Company on our proprietary thin-stock
developed for cardists.For this reason, and in contrast, the proposed design system looks forward to minimalism and
discreet design so to have the least impact possible in the cards design appreciation. Thus allowing the cards to excel
and to stand out. This is achieved with a low contrast background only introducing contrasting elements where
necessary."

            <p>The goal of this design was meant to be as easy and as simples to use as possible. For that reason, and
                because de product allowed it the product page was embedded in the main homepage.</p>
            <p>To a cardistry affectionate, the most important is to see the package, the card’s back, the court cards
                and
                an example of a numbered card. On top of these, it’s important to offer a description of the deck’s
                concept
                and a word about the designer.</p>

                <p>This design solution allows for a huge reduction of pages and clicks merging the address and payment
                    inputs
                    as well as the card confirmation pages.</p>
                <p>This way the user can deal with all the requirements all on one page. Note for the payment methods
                    wich
                    each
                    option will open a different set of input requirements underneath the chosen option.</p>
                <p>This not only reduces the number of processes the user has to go through as well as reduces the
                    number of
                    pages to be developed.</p>
