description: "Google Trends is a public web tool, based on Google Search, that shows how often a particular search-term
is entered relative to the total search-volume across various regions of the world, and in various languages. Based on
this information, one can represent graphically this information thus creating relations and finding patterns that,
otherwise, would be invisible.Here it is shown some of the most popular search terms of the year of 2015 and, for each
one, the top 5 countries with the most interest on that subject."
